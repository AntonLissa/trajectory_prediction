# Car Trajectory Prediction at an Intersection Using LSTM Model
This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict car trajectories at a traffic intersection in the city of Coldwater. The video used for this project is a YouTube live-stream of the city of Coldwater (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByED80IKdIU).

The project is divided into three main phases, each managed by a Google Colab notebook:
1. Data Acquisition: Processing of the video of a busy intersection to extract car trajectories.
2. Data Cleaning: Analyzing and cleaning the extracted data to obtain an accurate dataset.
3. Dataset Creation and Model Training: Creating a dataset with the cleaned data and training an LSTM model.
