# Car Trajectory Prediction at an Intersection Using LSTM Model
This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict car trajectories at a traffic intersection in the city of Coldwater. The video used for this project is a YouTube live-stream of the city of Coldwater (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByED80IKdIU).

The project is divided into three main phases, each managed by a Google Colab notebook:
1. Data Acquisition: Processing of the video of a busy intersection to extract car trajectories.
2. Data Cleaning: Analyzing and cleaning the extracted data to obtain an accurate dataset.
3. Dataset Creation and Model Training: Creating a dataset with the cleaned data and training an LSTM model.
# Folders
1. Models: in this folder there are the latest models developed
2. Dataframes: in this folder there are the some dataframes used for the creation of the dataset and training, the number after the dataframe name is the number of trajectories of each kind (see the code comments for more info)
3. Trajectories: contains the trajectories before and after the cleaning process
4. Videos: contains some videos of the result obtained by the networks
